.IP arch
Specifies the administrator defined system architecture requried.
This defaults to whatever the PBS_MACH string is set to in "local.mk".
Units: string.
.IP host
Name of host on which job should be run.  This resource is provided for
use by the site's scheduling policy.   The allowable values and effect
on job placement is site dependent.
Units: string.
.IP nodes
Number and/or type of nodes to be reserved for exclusive use by the job.
The value is one or more
.I node_specs
joined with the '+' character, "node_spec[+node_spec...].
Each node_spec is an
.I number
of nodes required of the type declared in the node_spec and a
.I name
or one or more
.I properity
or properities desired for the nodes.
The number, the name, and each properity in the node_spec are separated by
a colon ':'.  If no number is specified, one (1) is assumed.
Units: string.
.IP
The name of a node is its hostname.  The properities of nodes are:
.RS
.IP . 2
ppn=#
specifying the number of processors per node requested.  Defaults to 1.
.IP . 2
arbitrary string assigned by the system
administrator, please check with your administrator as to the node names
and properities available to you.
.RE
.IP
Examples:
.RS
.IP . 2

.IP . 2
To ask for 2 "server" nodes and 14 other nodes (a total of 16):
\-l\ nodes=2:server+14
.br
The above consist of two node_specs "2:server" and "14".
.IP . 2
To ask for (a) 1 node that is a "server" and has a "hippi" interface, (b) 10
nodes that are not servers, and (c) 3 nodes that have a large amount of memory
an have hippi:
.br
\-l\ nodes=server:hippi+10:noserver+3:bigmem:hippi
.IP . 2
To ask for three nodes by name:
.br
\-l\ nodes=b2005+b1803+b1813
.IP . 2
To ask for 2 processors on each of four nodes:
.br
\-l\ nodes=4:ppn=2
.IP . 2
To ask for 4 processors on one node:
.br
\-l\ nodes=1:ppn=4

To ask for 2 processors on each of two blue nodes and three processors on
one red node:

The resource values take the following units:
.IP time 8
specifies a maximum time period the resource can be used.  Time is expressed
in seconds as an integer, or in the form:
.br
.Ty [[hours:]minutes:]seconds[.milliseconds]
.IP size 8
specifies the maximum amount in terms of bytes or words.  It is expressed
in the form
.Ty integer[suffix]
The suffix is a multiplier defined in the following table,
'b' means bytes (the default) and 'w' means words.
The size of a word is the word size on the execution host.
.RS
.IP "\ b\ or\ \ w" 12
bytes or words.
.IP "kb\ or\ kw"
Kilo (1024) bytes or words.
.IP "mb\ or\ mw" 12
